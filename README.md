## OpenCPM

A public repository to facilitate the discussion and development of OpenCPM, an open source credit portfolio modelling suite. The repository stores mockups/ proof of principle implementations etc. At this stage we are in pre-alpha, little to download but we welcome keen developers who want to be involved in OpenCPM from the very beginning.

The overall design of OpenCPM is expressed in this figure:

Further details will follow as we flesh out the designs through the test cases, mockups and other preliminary work
